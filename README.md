# Multi-agentic-Jobhunter

AI Job Hunt Agents ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¼
This project is a multi-agent AI system built in a Python notebook that automates key parts of the job application process. It uses a team of specialized AI agents to write tailored cover letters, craft professional networking messages, and provide strategic reviews of your CV against a specific job description.

Run the colab notebbok, add your openai api key, upload your CV, paste the job link whenever it asks you to.

At the end you will have a simple gradio UI to use this system as your personal assistant in your job hunt
